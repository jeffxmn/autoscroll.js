Make sure you have JQuery included!\r\n\r\n## Using delayedscroll.js\r\n\r\nTo create full-height-width pages with the delayed scrolling effect, you must first add a ```delayedscroll``` class to a container ```<div>``` directly under ```<body>```:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"delayedscroll\">\r\n        <!-- Pages here -->\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach page is then a nested ```<div>``` under the ```delayedscroll``` div, labeled as ```page-*```, where * is the page number, starting from 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"delayedscroll\">\r\n        <div class=\"page-1\">\r\n            <span>Hi, I'm Page 1</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"page-2\">\r\n            <span>Nice meeting you! I'm Page 2</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"page-3\">\r\n            <!-- AFK -->\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! You should now be experiencing a surreal delayed scrolling effect on full-height-width pages. Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n### Browser Support\r\n\r\ndelayedscroll.js has been tested on:\r\n\r\n    - Chrome 25.0 and up\r\n    - Firefox 20.0.1 and up\r\n    - Internet Explorer 10\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nFeel free to contribute to the project!
