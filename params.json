{"name":"autoscroll.js","tagline":"A JavaScript library that enables delayed, automatic, scrolling","body":"### autoscroll.js\r\n\r\n## Including autoscroll.js in your website\r\n\r\n**autoscroll.js** is a JavaScript library that enables delayed, automatic, scrolling on one-page, full-width websites.\r\n\r\nThe library is lightweight and implementation is straightforward.\r\n\r\nTo include the library in your website, you need to include two files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<link href=\"css/autoscroll.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"js/delayedscroll.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**__Note:__** autoscroll.js also depends on JQuery. Make sure you have JQuery included!\r\n\r\n## Using autoscroll.js\r\n\r\nTo create full-height-width pages with the delayed scrolling effect, you must first add a ```autoscroll``` class to a container ```<div>``` directly under ```<body>```:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"autoscroll\">\r\n        <!-- Pages here -->\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach page is then a nested ```<div>``` under the ```delayedscroll``` div, labeled as ```page-*```, where * is the page number, starting from 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<body>\r\n    <div class=\"autoscroll\">\r\n        <div class=\"page-1\">\r\n            <span>Hi, I'm Page 1</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"page-2\">\r\n            <span>Nice meeting you! I'm Page 2</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"page-3\">\r\n            <!-- AFK -->\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! You should now be experiencing a surreal delayed scrolling effect on full-height-width pages. Enjoy! :)\r\n\r\n### Browser Support\r\n\r\nautoscroll.js has been tested on:\r\n\r\n    - Chrome 25.0 and up\r\n    - Firefox 20.0.1 and up\r\n    - Internet Explorer 10\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nStay tuned!
